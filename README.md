# Seamless Loading Screen (Forge)

**Seamless Loading Screen** is a mod that takes a screenshot of the game when you leave a world or server, and displays it when you rejoin it.

**Note**: This is the **forge** port of Seamless Loading Screen. You may find the fabric version here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/seamless-loading-screen. Not all features have been ported over yet (realm support, update world icons, archived screenshots)
